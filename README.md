# MINTmap
If you are viewing this from the github.com website, this is the code repository for my (Stefan Lang) fork of <a href="https://github.com/TJU-CMC-Org/MINTmap">the MINTmap program</a>.
The software can now be installed as perl module and can thereafter by used system wide.

The additional MINTmerge.pl requires my Stefans_Lib_Esentials perl libraries to be installed. Please follow the install instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/stela2502/Stefans_Lib_Esentials">respective GutHub page</a>.

If you just want to download the ORIGINAL latest version for basic usage, please visit https://cm.jefferson.edu/MINTcodes/ and follow the MINTmap download link there.

The file README_and_LICENSE.txt contains the ORIGINAL information on how to run the tool and license information from the MINTmap source.
